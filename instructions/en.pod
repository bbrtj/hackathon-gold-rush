=head1 Rules

The game is taking place on one-dimentional map of finite size. Map position is
denoted with a single natural number. Somewhere on the map are located gold
deposits whose position is unknown to players. The number of those deposits is
limited. The game is played in a turn-based system - after they performed all
actions, the players must decide if they want to proceed to the next turn,
which progresses all time-based actions. Each player has their own separate map
and any interaction between the players is not possible.

Player starts the game with the following assets:

=over

=item

One settlement on position C<0> with population count of C<3>

=item

C<50> gold pieces (GP)

=back

The goal of the game is to grow the infrastructure and gain gold by taking
ground and recruiting units. Available unit types are:

=over

=item

Explorer, who can explore the area and establish new settlements.

=item

Worker, who can mine gold.

=back

Recruitment of new units requires reducing the settlement population count by
C<1> and paying a fixed price in gold. The recruitment is instant and the new
unit can be used before ending the turn.

Population growth in settlements undergoes automatically. Each settlement which
contains at least C<2> residents will gain new population every C<3> turns. The
population growth equation is as follows: C<ceil(100 / (-x - 18.1) + 5)>.

Since new settlements have population count of 1, they won't have any
population growth. It's possible to C<resettle> population from one settlement
to the other. It takes the same amount of time as it would take any other unit
to travel. During the transport the population does not grow. The gold is
available globally and there's no need to transport it.

The game will only last a fixed amount of turns.

=head1 Units

Each unit moves at a rate of C<1> field per turn.

=head2 Explorer

I<costs 20 GP>

The explorer can be tasked to examine the terrain (C<send_explorer>). Upon
moving though each field they have C<40%> chance of detecting a gold deposit
that is located there. If they succeed, they establish a mine which can be
populated with workers. After reaching the target of his expedition, the
explorer goes back to the nearest settlement.

Another use of explorers is establishing new settlements
(C<send_explorer_settle>). A new settlement cannot be established less than
C<5> units away from an existing one. After starting a settlement the explorer
is no longer available. The new settlement has a population count of C<1>. If
upon reaching his destination a new settlement has been started in too close
proximity, the explorer returns to the nearest village.

=head2 Worker

I<costs 10 GP>

After populating a mine (C<send_worker>), the worker will mine C<0.5 GP> from
it every turn. There is no limit to a number of workers in a mine, however each
muliple of C<10> workers will cause the next C<10> to mine C<20%> less. This
means that first 10 will mine 100%, the second ten will mine 80%, the third ten
will mine 64% (80% * 80%) and so on. If a settlement is established on a mine,
an idle worker in that settlement is not mining gold automatically but has to
be sent to it. Starting a village on a deposit does not cause workers to
automatically mine gold from it.

=head1 API

All methods use GET/POST parameters and return JSON-encoded object. This object
always contains a C<status> field, which is a true value in case of success and
a false value in case of an error. Additionally, a C<result> field is available
upon success (returned value), and an C<error> field upon error (error code).

=over

=item

C<new_player(name): player> - Creates a new simulation for a player with name
C<name>. Returns the player id

=item

C<get_state(player): object> - Returns player's simulation state. Object
fields:

	- turn - turn number
	- gold - gold count
	- settlements, mines - settlement and mine information (array of objects)
		- id - settlement / mine identifier
		- population - settlement population / number of workers in a mine
		- position - settlement / mine position
	- explorers, workers - units information
		- id - unit identifier
		- position - unit position
		- idle - is the unit idle (1/0)
	- pseudounits - pseudounits information (currently - population transfers)
		- id - unit identifier
		- position - unit position
		- idle - is the unit idle (1/0)

=item

C<end_turn(player): turn> - ends player's turn. Returns the number of a new
turn

=item

C<train_worker(player, settlement): worker> - trains a new worker in a
settlement. Returns the identifier

=item

C<train_explorer(player, settlement): explorer> - trains a new explorer in a
settlement. Returns the identifier

=item

C<send_worker(player, worker, mine): time> - sends a worker to a mine. Returns
ETA

=item

C<send_explorer(player, explorer, position): time> - sends an explorer to
explore the area. Returns ETA

=item

C<send_explorer_settle(player, explorer, position): time> - sends an explorer
to establish a settlement. Returns ETA

=item

C<resettle(player, count, settlement_from, settlement_to): time> - transports
population between the settlements. Returns ETA

=back

=head1 WebSocket API

API is handy to kickstart a communication layer in the early phase, however
once the algorithm is playing for hundreds of turns it is recommended to use
the WebSocket connection. This API exposes the same format as stated above with
just a single difference - actions which require the C<player> field does not
accept it explicitly, but instead the C<new_player> action causes the websocket
connection to hold the player state.
